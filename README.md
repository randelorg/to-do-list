# to-do-list

#This will be using MySql Database

A CRUD Project

I will be doing a to -do list, because organizing my tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make me feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of my completed and uncompleted tasks will help me feel organized and stay mentally focused.
Especially now, where we dont have a face to face and all the taks are being posted online. This will help me to list all the task and be organized so no task are left behind and left unfinished.
